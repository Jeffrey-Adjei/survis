abstract = {The stock market is highly volatile as it depends on political, financial, environmental, and various internal and external factors along with historical stock data. Such information is available to people through microblogs and news and predicting stock price merely on historical data is hard. The high volatility emphasizes the importance to check the effect of external factors on the stock market. In this paper, a machine learning model is proposed where the financial news is used along with historical stock price data to predict upcoming stock prices. The paper has used three algorithms to calculate various sentiment scores and used them in different combinations to understand the impact of financial news on stock price as well the impact of each sentiment scoring algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on ten-year historical stock price data as well as financial news of four different companies from different sectors to predict the next day and next week's stock trends and accuracy metrics were checked for a period of 10, 30, and 100 days. The proposed model can achieve the highest accuracy of 0.90 for both trend and future trends for a period of 10 days. Experiments have also been performed to check the difficulty in predicting some stocks. It was found that Tata Motors an automobile company stock prediction has maximum MAPE and hence deviates more from actual prediction as compared to others.}

abstract = {The goal of this research is to build a model to predict stock price movement using the sentiment from social media. Unlike previous approaches where the overall moods or sentiments are considered, the sentiments of the specific topics of the company are incorporated into the stock prediction model. Topics and related sentiments are automatically extracted from the texts in a message board by using our proposed method as well as existing topic models. In addition, this paper shows an evaluation of the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis in the stock prediction task via a large scale experiment. Comparing the accuracy average over 18 stocks in one year transaction, our method achieved 2.07% better performance than the model using historical prices only. Furthermore, when comparing the methods only for the stocks that are difficult to predict, our method achieved 9.83% better accuracy than historical price method, and 3.03% better than human sentiment method.}

    abstract = { The use of deep learning, specifically time series neural networks, in predicting stock market trends has emerged as a significant use case in financial analysis. However, the complex interrelationships and instability of the stock market have made the timely and accurate prediction of its behaviour as a confronting endeavour. To address this difficulty, in this research work a stock market index prediction model called SenT-In, which combines the with a sentiment awareness model. A sentiment awareness model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed to calculate the sentiment index of a large volume of news articles collected from reputable financial websites. In addition, a sentiment attention method is developed to combine stock data and news sentiment index as the input for training and predicting using the SenT-In network, which is both simple and efficient. The proposed model is evaluated in four different stock market datasets which include FSTE, SSE, Nifty 50 and S\&amp;P 500. On comparing the results with conventional deep learning algorithms such as GRU, LSTM, CNN and SVM, proposed SenT-In outperforms existing methods in accuracy with 9\%, F1-Score with 7\%, AUC-ROC curve with 13\% and PR-AUC curve with 9\% efficiency (on average). }

abstract = {Financial news articles are believed to have impacts on stock price return. Previous works model news pieces in bag-of-words space, which analyzes the latent relationship between word statistical patterns and stock price movements. However, news sentiment, which is an important ring on the chain of mapping from the word patterns to the price movements, is rarely touched. In this paper, we first implement a generic stock price prediction framework, and plug in six different models with different analyzing approaches. To take one step further, we use Harvard psychological dictionary and Loughran–McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to construct a sentiment space. Textual news articles are then quantitatively measured and projected onto the sentiment space. Instance labeling method is rigorously discussed and tested. We evaluate the models’ prediction accuracy and empirically compare their performance at different market classification levels. Experiments are conducted on five years historical Hong Kong Stock Exchange prices and news articles. Results show that (1) at individual stock, sector and index levels, the models with sentiment analysis outperform the bag-of-words model in both validation set and independent testing set; (2) the models which use sentiment polarity cannot provide useful predictions; (3) there is a minor difference between the models using two different sentiment dictionaries.}

  abstract={This paper proposes a stock price prediction model, which extracts features from time series data and social networks for prediction of stock prices and evaluates its performance. In this research, we use the features such as numerical dynamics (frequency) of news and comments, overall sentiment analysis of news and comments, as well as technical analysis of historic price and volume. We model the stock price movements as a function of these input features and solve it as a regression problem in a Multiple Kernel Learning regression framework. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of magnitude prediction measures such as RMSE, MAE and MAPE for three famous Japan companies' stocks in US stock market. The results indicate that features other than mining from stock prices themselves improved the performance.},

  abstract={Stock prices and financial markets are often sentiment-driven, which leads to research efforts to predict stock market trend using public sentiments expressed on social media such as Facebook and Twitter. In this project, we investigate the impact of sentiment expressed through StockTwits on stock price prediction. StockTwits is a relatively new microblogging website, which is becoming increasingly popular for users to share their discussions and sentiments about stocks and financial markets. Specifically, we analyze the StockTwits tweet contents and extract financial sentiment using a set of text featurization and machine learning algorithms. The correlation between the aggregated daily sentiment and daily stock price movement is then studied. Finally, the sentiment information is used in addition to the past stock time series data to improve the accuracy of stock price movement prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed work on stock price prediction is demonstrated through experiments on five companies (Apple, Amazon, General Electric, Microsoft, and Target) using nine-month StockTwits data and daily stock data.},

  abstract={Predicting stock market prices has been a topic of interest among both analysts and researchers for a long time. Stock prices are hard to predict because of their high volatile nature which depends on diverse political and economic factors, change of leadership, investor sentiment, and many other factors. Predicting stock prices based on either historical data or textual information alone has proven to be insufficient. Existing studies in sentiment analysis have found that there is a strong correlation between the movement of stock prices and the publication of news articles. Several sentiment analysis studies have been attempted at various levels using algorithms such as support vector machines, naive Bayes regression, and deep learning. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms depends upon the amount of training data provided. However, the amount of textual data collected and analyzed during the past studies has been insufficient and thus has resulted in predictions with low accuracy. In our paper, we improve the accuracy of stock price predictions by gathering a large amount of time series data and analyzing it in relation to related news articles, using deep learning models. The dataset we have gathered includes daily stock prices for S&P500 companies for five years, along with more than 265,000 financial news articles related to these companies. Given the large size of the dataset, we use cloud computing as an invaluable resource for training prediction models and performing inference for a given stock in real time.},
